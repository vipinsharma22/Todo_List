Create a dynamic To-Do List Using JavaScript

initially there should be an ADD button to add a new entry to the list.
List should have 2 columns: DATE and DESCRIPTION
List should be sortable using any of the column.
Sorting should work in ascending as well as in descending order.

each row should have a delete button on the right side which would delete a particular row.

On clicking the ADD button, 2 inputs should appear one for a calendar and one for Description, there should be 2 options CANCEL and OK, if user clicks CANCEL, it should remove the input fields without any changes, but if user clicks OK then new rows should create in the TO-DO List and the input fields should disappear.
